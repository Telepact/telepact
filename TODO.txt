High:
- Clean up dangling print statements
- Make sure bytes type always returns as bytes from client lib interface

Medium:
- Also remove mock-internal from binary encoding like internal is omitted
- Write tests for the cli mock and demo-server subcommands
- Write tests that verify each type within a "link" function
- Add backwards compatibility check to cli
- Add http url as a Telepact source for code generation
- Move self-hosted console to example directory instead of tool directory
- Add websocket support in doc ui
- Add websocket support in cli

Low:
- Maybe: replace info. with telepact. and don't show type in console
- For the random string generation, use random words rather than random chars
- console: Improve consistency around simluation naming. Still have lingering ideas around mock and example.
- Expose mock server options as command-line args in the cli
- Console light mode and listen to os setting
- Remove no-op output from `make license-header` and `make version`
- Clean up java test code coverage errors
