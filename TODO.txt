High:
- Add license header to all coding files
- Add a CI verification step using project cli that ensures all projects match VERSION.txt

Medium:
- maybe: Prepend all headers with @ symbol (or similar idea)
- Add http url as a Telepact source for code generation
- Add websocket support in doc ui
- Add websocket support in cli
- Add websocket support for mock docker

Low:
- Remove unnecessary installation of pipx in github actions, apparently it might already be installed
- Remove idl folder
- @msgpack/msgpack might be an unused dependency in lib/ts
- Replace info. with telepact. and don't show type in console
- For the random string generation, use random words rather than random chars
- Improve consistency around simluation naming. Still have lingering
  ideas around mock and example.
- Expose mock server options as command-line args in the cli
- Remove unnecessary "telepact" everywhere in github actions
- Console light mode and listen to os setting
