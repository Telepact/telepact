- Formally vendor msgpact ts in dart lib
- Add license header to all coding files

- Remove idl folder
- @msgpack/msgpack might be an unused dependency in lib/ts
- Replace info. with msgpact. and don't show type in console
- For the random string generation, use random words rather than random chars
- Improve consistency around simluation naming. Still have lingering
  ideas around mock and example.
- Expose mock server options as command-line args in the cli
- Remove unnecessary "msgpact" everywhere in github actions
- maybe: Prepend all headers with @ symbol (or similar idea)
- docker test does not need to reference the calculator.msgpact.json file
