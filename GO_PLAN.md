# Background

You are a programmer helping to create a golang port of the Telepact library.
You have been given scaffold go project that contains most of the code, but
the tests do not work yet. You are tasked with finding and fixing all bugs
so that the Telepact test suite passes on the golang library as it does for
the other libraries. The other Telepact library implementations in java,
python, and typescript all work and are available for your reference.

# Goal

Your goal is to get `make test-trace-go` to succeed.

Be sure to run `make test-trace-java`, `make test-trace-py`, and `make test-trace-ts`
to learn what success looks like.
